## Analysis of Human Brast Cancer Cells

First we need to import our input data

```{r}
wisc.df <- read.csv("WisconsinCancer.csv")
head(wisc.df)
```

There are some funky things in this dataset that we will ignore for our analysis. This includes the ID, and Diagnosis columns and the funny last X column.

```{r}
#convert the features of the data: wisc.data
wisc.data <- as.matrix(wisc.df[, 3:32])
head(wisc.data)
```

Q. How many patients do we have data for?

```{r}
nrow(wisc.data)
```

Q. How many cancer and non-cancer?

```{r}
table(wisc.df$diagnosis)
```

Q. How many variables in the data are suffixed with _mean?

```{r}
grep("_mean", colnames(wisc.data))
```
```{r}
length(grep("_mean", colnames(wisc.data)))

```


## Principal Component Analysis

Before we turn to PCA we need to think, or consider, whether we should SCALE our input.

It is important to check if the data need to be scaled before performing PCA. Recall two common reasons for scaling data include:

-The input variables use different units of measurement.
-The input variables have significantly different variances.
-Check the mean and standard deviation of the features (i.e. columns) of the wisc.data to determine if the data should be scaled. Use the colMeans() and apply() functions like you’ve done before.

```{r}
round(apply(wisc.data, 2, sd), 2)
```

Looks like we need to set SCALE = TRUE!!

```{r}
# Perform PCA on wisc.data by completing the following code
wisc.pr <- prcomp(wisc.data, scale = TRUE)
summary(wisc.pr)
```

Q. From your results, what proportion of the original variance is captured by the first principal components (PC1)?
  
  The 1st PC captures 44.27% of the original variance. 72.6% is captured in the first 3 PCs

Let's make some figures

```{r}
biplot(wisc.pr)
```

That is a hot mess! We need to do our own PC1 vs PC2 plot and lets color by the diagnosis.

```{r}
attributes(wisc.pr)
```

```{r}
plot(wisc.pr$x[, 1], wisc.pr$x[, 2], col = wisc.df$diagnosis)
abline(h = 0, col = "gray", lty = 2)
abline(v = 0, col = "gray", lty = 2)
```

##Cluster in PC space

First lets see if we can cluster the original data

```{r}
wisc.hc <- hclust(dist(wisc.data))
plot(wisc.hc)
```

This does not look good! Let's try and combine the results of PCA with clustering

Using the minimum number of principal components required to describe at least 90% of the variability in the data, create a hierarchical clustering model with the linkage method="ward.D2". We use Ward’s criterion here because it is based on multidimensional variance like principal components analysis. Assign the results to wisc.pr.hclust.

```{r}
wisc.pr.hclust <- hclust(dist(wisc.pr$x[, 1:3]), method = "ward.D2")
plot(wisc.pr.hclust)
```

To get our cluster out of this tree we need to CUT it with the 'cutree()' function.

```{r}
grps3 <- cutree(wisc.pr.hclust, k = 2)
table(grps3)
```

```{r}
plot(wisc.pr$x[, 1], wisc.pr$x[, 2], col = grps3)
```

We can use the 'table()' function to comapre the $diagnosis vector with out cluster results vector

```{r}
table(grps3, wisc.df$diagnosis)
```

## Prediction
We will use the predict() function that will take our PCA model from befor and new cancer cell data and project that data onto our PCA space

```{r}
new <- read.csv("new_samples.csv")
new
```


Use the 'predict()' function with our previous PCA model and new data

```{r}
npc <- predict(wisc.pr, newdata = new)
npc
```

Now draw the PCA plot again and add our new data:

```{r}
plot(wisc.pr$x[, 1], wisc.pr$x[, 2], col = wisc.df$diagnosis)
points(npc[, 1], npc[, 2], col = "blue", pch = 15, cex = 3)
text(npc[, 1], npc[, 2], labels = c(1, 2), col = "white")
```
