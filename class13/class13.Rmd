## Download and clean HIV-Pr receptor structure

Here we will download the 1HSG PDB structure from the online database, remove the bound drug from Merk and write out a protein only and ligand only new set of PDB files.

We will use the bio3d **package** functions 'get.pdb()', 'read.pdb()', 'atom.select()', and finally 'write.pdb()'

First we have to load the package with a call to 'library(bio3d)'

```{r}
library(bio3d)

#Download PDB file
file.name <- get.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb(file.name)
pdb
```

Select Protein only
```{r}
prot <- atom.select(pdb, "protein", value = TRUE)
write.pdb(prot, file = "1hsg_protein.pdb")
```

Select ligand only
```{r}
lig <- atom.select(pdb, "ligand", value = TRUE)
write.pdb(lig, file = "1hsg_ligand.pdb")
```

```{r}
lig
```
